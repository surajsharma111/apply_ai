Roadmap: AI Job-Apply MVP
(Single-user, 3–4 weeks working part-time — can compress to ~2 weeks full-time)

Week 1: Core Setup & Job Data Collection
Goal: Get a working backend + database + first scrapers.

Day 1–2: Project Setup
Set up GitHub repo for your project.

Initialize Python project with virtualenv.

Install FastAPI, Uvicorn, Playwright, psycopg2.

Set up Docker + PostgreSQL for persistent storage.

Create FastAPI starter server (/ returns “API running”).

Day 3–4: Database Design
Create jobs table:

company, title, location, url, description, date_posted, date_scraped.

Create a DB helper class for inserting & querying jobs.

Day 5–6: First Scraper
Build a Playwright scraper for Atlassian careers.

Parse: Job title, location, job URL, and (if easy) description.

Save to DB.

Run it & test.

Day 7: Add More Companies
Duplicate scraper for 4 more companies:

Canva, AWS, Telstra, WiseTech.

Schedule cron job (daily scraping).

End of Week 1:

You have a working FastAPI backend.

5 company scrapers writing jobs into PostgreSQL.

Week 2: AI Matching & RAG
Goal: Use AI to match jobs to you and generate tailored resumes/cover letters.

Day 1–2: Profile Data
Create a JSON file for your resume (skills, projects, experience).

Example:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "Suraj Sharma",
  "skills": ["React", "Node.js", "FastAPI"],
  "projects": [
    {"name": "CallStream", "desc": "Video conferencing with MFA"},
    {"name": "HyperGrocery", "desc": "Full-stack grocery app"}
  ]
}
Day 3–4: Vector Search (RAG)
Set up a vector DB (Chroma or Pinecone).

Store job descriptions & your resume data as embeddings.

Use LangChain to do semantic search:

Query: “Find React Developer roles in Sydney.”

Get top-matching jobs.

Day 5–6: Cover Letter & Resume Generator
Use OpenAI GPT‑4 with LangChain to:

Generate a tailored cover letter for each job.

Adjust your resume content for each job (skills/project emphasis).

End of Week 2:

You can query jobs by skill/location.

AI generates a tailored cover letter & resume snippet per job.

Week 3: Application Flow
Goal: Create a semi-automatic application system.

Day 1–2: Resume/CL Output
Convert AI-generated content to PDFs (e.g., pdfkit or WeasyPrint).

Save as jobid_resume.pdf and jobid_coverletter.pdf.

Day 3–5: Semi-Auto Apply
Build a Playwright bot:

Opens job application form.

Pre-fills name, email, resume, cover letter.

Stops before submission (you manually click submit).

Day 6–7: Command-Line Interface
Create a CLI tool:

python find_jobs.py --skill "React" --location "Sydney"

Lists matching jobs + generates resumes & cover letters.

End of Week 3:

End-to-end workflow working:

Scrape → Match → Generate Resume/CL → Pre-fill job application.

Week 4: Polishing (Optional)
Add 10–15 more company scrapers.

Improve AI prompts for better CL personalization.

Add email notifications (“New 5 jobs found for you”).

Add basic dashboard (React) if time permits.

Timeline Summary
Week 1: Backend + DB + 5 scrapers.

Week 2: AI RAG pipeline + tailored resume/CL.

Week 3: Semi-auto apply (pre-filled job forms).

Week 4 (optional): Add more scrapers + notifications + small UI.

How Long?
Part-time (2–3 hrs/day): ~4 weeks.

Full-time (6–8 hrs/day): ~2 weeks.

Next Step
Do you want me to prepare a GitHub-ready starter project (FastAPI + DB + first scraper + placeholder AI)?
That way you can clone and start coding immediately.

Or should I make a detailed Trello/Notion task board (so you track day-by-day progress)?

Which one first — starter codebase or task board?

And after mvp how long do you think it will take to make actual product 


ChatGPT said:
Great — this is the big-picture question: How long from MVP → real product?

Let’s break it down.

From MVP to Full Product (SaaS)
Your MVP (single‑user tool) gives you:

Scraping + job database

AI‑generated resumes & cover letters

Semi‑auto apply

A real product (multi‑user SaaS) needs:

Multi‑user system

Authentication, onboarding, secure storage of resumes & preferences

Each user’s job search criteria, saved jobs, history

Dynamic scrapers

Expand to 100+ companies

Self‑adapting scrapers (AI‑driven selectors so they don’t break if the site changes)

Optionally integrate with job board APIs (LinkedIn, Indeed, Workday, Greenhouse)

Fully automated applications

Auto‑submit with Playwright bots for ATS systems (Workday, Lever, Greenhouse, etc.)

Handle captchas, 2FA (via APIs or human‑in‑the‑loop services)

User dashboard (Frontend)

React + Tailwind dashboard

Job recommendations, application tracking, generated resumes/cover letters

Filters & alerts

Notifications & scheduling

Daily job alerts (email/SMS)

Queue system for scraping + applying (Celery + Redis)

Production‑ready backend

FastAPI microservices (scraping, AI, applications, notifications)

PostgreSQL + Vector DB for scalable storage

Deployed on AWS/GCP/Azure with Docker/Kubernetes

Security & compliance

Encrypt user data (resumes, credentials)

GDPR/privacy policy for handling personal data

Timeline Estimate
If you’re working solo (part‑time):

Phase 1 – MVP (done in 3–4 weeks)

Phase 2 – Multi‑user + dynamic scrapers: ~4–6 weeks

Phase 3 – Fully automated applications: ~3–4 weeks

Phase 4 – Dashboard + notifications: ~3–4 weeks

Phase 5 – Production readiness (deployment, security): ~2–3 weeks

Total: ~3–4 months (part‑time)
If you go full‑time or with a small team: ≈ 6–8 weeks.

Practical Plan
Month 1: Finish MVP + polish scraping & AI generation.

Month 2: Add multi‑user support + scalable scraping system.

Month 3: Automate application submissions & launch a simple dashboard.

Key Milestone for Product Launch
Private Beta: ~2 months → Invite friends to use it.

Public Beta: ~3–4 months → Launch as SaaS (maybe with a freemium model).

Bottom line:

MVP: ~3–4 weeks.
Production SaaS: ~2–4 months, depending on how polished & automated you want it.
